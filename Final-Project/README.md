## DOMAIN OF INTEREST

Our focus is on mental health. More specifically, we would like to explore prevalence rates, access to treatment and mental healthcare, and external factors such as socio-economic factors, industry/jobs, and geographic location.

_**Why are we interested in this field/domain?**_

We are interested in Mental Health as our focus because it is a meaningful topic that interests us both academically and personally. Mental health can affect anyone at some point in their life - people can become mentally ill, get diagnosed with a mental health disorder, or know someone (family, friend, colleague) who is challenged by mental health. This universal experience is an interesting topic to study due to its widespread impact. We are primarily interested in prevalence, access to treatment or care, external factors such as poverty/wealth, and education level, all related to geographic location.

_**What are three other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain?**_

[This interactive tool](https://mihiriyer.shinyapps.io/MentalHealth/) shows statistics from the Veterans Affairs department for 2015. You can search by such measures as prevalence, testing, and confirmed diagnosis percentages at VA hospitals around the USA.

[This analysis](https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health) tracks metal health around the world with the ability to focus on specific countries and view prevalence changes from 1990 - 2017. You can also view a general distribution of mental health disorders for each country.

[This interactive graphic](https://www.chcf.org/publication/mapping-gaps-mental-health-california/) maps mental health as it relates to poverty and access to care for the different counties in California. From the website: “The state’s poorest areas often have the highest rates of mental illness, and they are also among the regions with the fewest licensed mental health professionals to provide treatment.”

_**Questions that we hope to answer and/or explore around Mental Health:**_  
- What mental illness(es) or disorder(s) are most common in different regions of the US?  
- What is the state of mental health by age group/area?  
- How many hospitals/treatment centers for mental health are located in different regions of the US?
- Is a high number of treatment options tied to better mental health outcomes?  
- Is access to care (or lack thereof) tied to the mental health of an area?
- What is the effectiveness of different mental healthcare/treatment options?
- Is poverty tied to the mental health of an area?
- What is the role of education in mental health? Maybe look at level of schooling based on census data.  

## INITIAL SOURCES:

### Source 1: [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

**About the Data:**  
This data was collected from a 2014 survey conducted by “Open Sourcing Mental Illness”, a non-profit corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The survey explored the perspective of people in the tech industry towards their own mental health, the culture and attitudes surrounding mental health, and the prevalence of mental health disorders.  

The dataset was found and downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).

**Dataset Dimensions:**  
- 1259 observations (rows)
- 27 features (columns)

**Questions that can be answered using the data in this dataset:**  
Based on the features and observations included in this dataset, the following questions can be explored:   
- Out of all the people who have sought treatment for a mental health condition in the past:  
   - How many of them work in company that provides mental health benefits?  
   - How many of them know what mental health resources are available to them with their employment?  
   - How many of them feel like they can talk to people at work about their problems and be taken seriously?  
- How do attitudes around the stigma of mental health in the tech workplace differ between age and gender?

Questions from above that could also be addressed/explored based on relevant features and observations:
- What is the state of mental health by age group/area?  

### Source 2: [National Veteran Health Equity Report](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-veteran-health-equity-report-fy13)

**About the Data:**   
This data was collected via a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, which provides open, accessible, and usable data to the public related to various veteran affairs. The U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs is also known to provide a plethora of services to veterans, most notably mental healthcare, especially for disorders like PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).

The dataset was found and downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-veteran-health-equity-report-fy13).

**Dataset Dimensions:**  
- 1364 observations (rows)
- 33 features (columns)

**Questions that can be answered using the data in this dataset:**    
The dataset includes some demographic information about patients (veterans), their mental health status after treatment, the type of mental illness or disorders they have or have experienced, and more. Thus, the following questions can be explored:

- Is a high number of treatment options tied to better mental health outcomes?
- What is the effectiveness of different mental healthcare/treatment options?
- What is the state of mental health by age group/area?  

### Source 3: [Patient Characteristics Survey](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/patient-characteristics-survey-pcs-2015)

**About the Data:**   
The data was collected via survey - the Patient Characteristics Survey (PCS) - in 2015 and is maintained by NY Open Data (New York), which is a community that provides free public access to various data published by agencies and organizations in New York. The survey was conducted by the New York State Office of Mental Health, which is a local government-run mental health system that manages psychiatric centers and mental health services. They conduct surveys such as this one every two years.

The dataset was found and downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/patient-characteristics-survey-pcs-2015).

**Dataset Dimensions:**  
- 179,096 observations (rows)
- 67 features (columns)

**Questions that can be answered using the data in this dataset:**  
This dataset includes features and observations about patients' level of education, employment, living situation, mental health disorders and complications, and more. Thus, the following questions can be addressed or further explored:

- What is the state of mental health by age group/area?
- What is the role of education in mental health?
- What are the ratios of the number of people affected by certain mental health problems?
